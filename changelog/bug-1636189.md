The websocktunnel, livelog, and taskcluster-proxy images now have an `/app/version.json` as required by DockerFlow, and websocktunnel correctly services all three DockerFlow endpoints.  In additional, all `version.json` files including that in the main `taskcluster/taskcluster` image now have a correct build URL.
