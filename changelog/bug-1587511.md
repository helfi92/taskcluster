WorkerPools can now be configured to terminate workers that fail to register after some amount of time.
Both of the google and aws providers now support a `lifecycle` object that for now has a single key
of `registrationTimeout`. It is optional and if it is provided the value is an integer with the number
of seconds a worker has to register before it is terminated.

This helps catch misconfigured or broken workers before they become zombies or worse.
